config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_SYSINFO
	bool "Console Command: sysinfo"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the sysinfo console command, which shows statistics
	  about the current image copy running, reset flags, etc.

config PLATFORM_EC_HIBERNATE_PSL
	bool "System hibernating with PSL (Power Switch Logic) mechanism"
	depends on SOC_FAMILY_NPCX
	help
	  Use PSL (Power Switch Logic) for hibernating. It turns off VCC power
	  rail for ultra-low power consumption and uses PSL inputs rely on VSBY
	  power rail to wake up ec and the whole system.

config PLATFORM_EC_SYSTEM_PRE_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "System pre-initialization priority"
	default 20
	range 0 99
	help
	  This defines the initialization priority for the CROS
	  system_pre_init() function. system_pre_init() reads chip level reset
	  cause and stores it into the system reset flags. All drivers, except
	  those critical to determining the reset type, should be initialized at
	  lower priority so that the system reset flags are valid.

config PLATFORM_EC_FW_RESET_VECTOR
	bool "Firmware Reset Vector chip specific retrieval"
	default y if SOC_FAMILY_RISCV_ITE
	help
	  This defines if there is a chip specific machanism for
	  retrieving the firmware reset vector. The function that
	  needs to be provided is system_get_fw_reset_vector that
	  will return the address of the reset vector.

config PLATFORM_EC_SYSTEM_SAFE_MODE
	bool "Enable System Safe Mode"
	default n
	depends on (CPU_CORTEX_M || ARCH_POSIX)
	help
	  This enables system safe mode for retrieving system state after
	  a panic occurs. System safe mode only runs briefly after a panic.

config PLATFORM_EC_SYSTEM_SAFE_MODE_TIMEOUT_MSEC
	int "System safe mode timeout"
	default 2000
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_SYSTEM_SAFE_MODE
	help
	  Safe mode will force a system reset after this timeout. The system may
	  reset sooner if all safe mode tasks are completed before the timeout.
