config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DP_MODE
	bool "EC-driven DP support"
	depends on !PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_VDM_AP_CONTROL
	default y
	help
	  This enables support for entering DisplayPort alternate mode as a
	  DFP from the Embedded Controller directly.  This flag gates all the
	  on-EC logic for determining specifics such as VDM contents.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_REV30
	bool "USB PD Rev3.0 functionality"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this to allow Rev3.0 functionality, including features such as
	  Fast Role Swap, advertising the available power across all ports of a
	  multi-port charger, and USB4. If disabled, only USB Power Delivery
	  Rev2.0 functionality is supported.

	  This defaults to y because PD Rev3.0 is required for USB4
	  functionality.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_TBT_COMPAT_MODE
	bool "Thunderbolt-compatible mode support"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_REV30
	default n
	help
	  Enable this to allow entering into Thunderbolt-compatible mode between
	  two port partners. This does not require that USB4 mode be enabled.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_USB4
	bool "USB4 support"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_REV30
	default n
	help
	  This enables support for entering into USB4 mode between two port
	  partners. The provides new features such as higher speeds and more
	  flexible multiplexing of data on the cable for different purposes,
	  e.g. attaching multiple displays and storage devices on the same bus.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_3A_PORTS
	int "Number of USBC ports that can supply 3A"
	default 1
	help
	  Specifies the number of ports the platform can source 3.0A on
	  simultaneously.  When this setting is lower than the total number
	  of USB Type-C ports on the platform, the source policy logic
	  provides 3.0A to connected partners in this order.

	  1. PD capabable sinks that request more than 1.5A in their Get Sink
	     Caps response.
	  2. FRS capable sources that request 3.0A FRS current.
	  3. Non-PD sinks

	  To turn off 3.0A current allocation, set this field to 0.
