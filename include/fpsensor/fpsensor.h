 *
 * This function updates a static error variable with the following error codes
 * (whenever detected), which is read using the @ref fp_sensor_get_info function
 * defined in the same source file. The errors are ultimately read from the
 * application processor using the host command EC_CMD_FP_INFO:
 *
 * FP_ERROR_DEAD_PIXELS: The number of dead pixels detected on the sensor during
 * maintenance.
 *
 * FP_ERROR_DEAD_PIXELS_UNKNOWN: The number of dead pixels has not been tested
 * yet.
 *
 * FP_ERROR_NO_IRQ: No interrupt signal received from the sensor.
 *
 * FP_ERROR_SPI_COMM: Error in SPI communication with the sensor.
 *
 * FP_ERROR_BAD_HWID: Invalid sensor hardware ID.
 *
 * FP_ERROR_INIT_FAIL: Sensor initialization failed.

 * @return EC_SUCCESS always
